# day28-Pomodorotimer
A simple Pomodoro timer made in tkinter (python)

# What is Pomodoro?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that splits up tasks between periods of work and breaks:
- 25 minutes of work
- 5-10 mins short break
- repeat 3 times 
- every fifth break is a long break of 20-30 mins

this code is a part of my attempts to follow along the 100 days of code python course on udemy
